<h2>Setup</h2>
-->

<p>
  To participate in a Software Carpentry workshop, 
  you will need working copies of the software described below.
  Please make sure to install everything
  (or at least to download the installers)
  <em>before</em> the start of your workshop.  Please arrive early if you have any problems and require help from an instructor.
</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">

    <h4>Secure Shell & Secure Copy </h4>
    <p>
      <code>ssh</code> (secure shell) is an encrypted remote login tool. It lets you connect to remote resources, such as the OSG Connect login node and interact with the machine via UNIX shell.
      Similarly, <code>scp</code> (secure copy) is a tool that facilitates encrypted file transfer. We will use both to interact with OSG Connect.
    </p>
    <h4>Python</h4>
    <p>
      Python is becoming very popular in scientific computing,
      and it's a great language for teaching general programming concepts due to its easy-to-read syntax.
      Installing all the scientific packages for Python individually can be a bit difficult,
      so we recommend an all-in-one installer.
    </p>

    <h4>OSG </h4>
    <p>
    Training accounts will be available for the workshop, but if you are interested in continuing to use OSG we recommend that you create an account which you can keep after the workshop.  If you do not already have an account on the Open Science Grid and you would like one, lease 
    <a href="http://osgconnect.net/signup">Sign Up</a>. It takes 5-10 minutes 
 to complete the sign up process and about 30 minutes to get your account 
 activated.  
    </p>

<h3>Secure Shell</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  

    <h4>Windows </h4>
    <p>
      For secure shell (ssh), download <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">PuTTY</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For secure copy (scp), download <a href="http://winscp.net/eng/download.php">WinSCP</a>
    </p>
    
    <h4>Mac OS X</h4>
    <p>
      The tools (ssh, scp, ...) are usually already installed and available on the command line. 
    </p>
    
    <h4>Linux</h4>
    <p>
      The tools (ssh, scp, ...) are usually already installed and available on the command line.

<h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    research computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  Installing all of its research packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we recommend
    <a href="https://www.continuum.io/anaconda">Anaconda</a>,
    an all-in-one installer.
  </p>

    <p>
      Regardless of how you choose to install it,
      <strong>please make sure you install Python version 3.x</strong>
      (e.g., 3.4 is fine).
    </p>

    <p>
      We will teach Python using the IPython notebook, a programming environment
      that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably
      up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and
      Firefox browsers are all
      <a href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/install/install.html#browser-compatibility">supported</a>
      (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9
      and below, are not).
    </p>

      <h4 id="python-linux">Linux</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Open <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads">http://continuum.io/downloads</a> with your web browser.</li>
        <li>Download the Python 3 installer for Linux.<br>
          (Installation requires using the shell. If you aren't
           comfortable doing the installation yourself
           stop here and request help at the workshop.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Open a terminal window.
        </li>
        <li>
          Type <pre>bash Anaconda3-</pre> and then press
          tab. The name of the file you just downloaded should
          appear. If it does not, navigate to the folder where you
          downloaded the file, for example with:
          <pre>cd Downloads</pre>
          Then, try again.
        </li>
        <li>
          Press enter. You will follow the text-only prompts. To move through
          the text, press the space key. Type <code>yes</code> and
          press enter to approve the license. Press enter to approve the
          default location for the files. Type <code>yes</code> and
          press enter to prepend Anaconda to your <code>PATH</code>
          (this makes the Anaconda distribution the default Python).
        </li>
        <li>
          Close the terminal window.
