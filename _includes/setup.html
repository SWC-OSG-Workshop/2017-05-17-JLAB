<h2>Setup</h2>
-->

<p>
  To participate in a Software Carpentry workshop, 
  you will need working copies of the software described below.
  Please make sure to install everything
  (or at least to download the installers)
  <em>before</em> the start of your workshop.  Please arrive early if you have any problems and require help from an instructor.
</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">

    <h4>Secure Shell & Secure Copy </h4>
    <p>
      <code>ssh</code> (secure shell) is an encrypted remote login tool. It lets you connect to remote resources, such as the OSG Connect login node and interact with the machine via UNIX shell.
      Similarly, <code>scp</code> (secure copy) is a tool that facilitates encrypted file transfer. We will use both to interact with OSG Connect.
    </p>
    <h4>Python</h4>
    <p>
      Python is becoming very popular in scientific computing,
      and it's a great language for teaching general programming concepts due to its easy-to-read syntax.
      Installing all the scientific packages for Python individually can be a bit difficult,
      so we recommend an all-in-one installer.
    </p>

    <h4>OSG </h4>
    <p>
    Training accounts will be available for the workshop, but if you are interested in continuing to use OSG we recommend that you create an account which you can keep after the workshop.  If you do not already have an account on the Open Science Grid and you would like one, lease 
    <a href="http://osgconnect.net/signup">Sign Up</a>. It takes 5-10 minutes 
 to complete the sign up process and about 30 minutes to get your account 
 activated.
